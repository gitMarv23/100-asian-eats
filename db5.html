<h2 id="origins">Origins</h2>
<p>Neoculturation is a fantastic way to transform well-known, favorite
dishes into a blend of flavors and popularity. In this case of the
<em>Sushirrito</em> (a delicious combination of my two favorite dishes -
Sushi and Burrito), its origin actually occurred here in the United
States. The original Sushirrito began in San Francisco, California,
where a restaurant of the same name, <em>Sushirrito</em>, developed the
dish as “modern Japanese with a Latin twist” (Sushirrito, 2022). Since
its inception, there have been many modifications to its ingredients
that have included items such as tuna, pickled ginger, and wasabi
(Silcock, 2017). Even food truck businesses such as Jogasaki Sushi
Burrito have been acclaimed by high ranking companies such as Roaming
Hunger for their own twist on the popular dish (Jogasaki Sushi Burrito,
2023). The neoculturation has even transferred from the food industry to
<em>Do It Yourself (DIY)</em> recipes that everyone can try at home.
McCleary is a developer and traveller that has taken her own DIY twist
on the Sushirrito for at home individuals to create the dish at an
affordable value (McCleary, 2022).</p>

<p>The Sushirrito has two country origins - one involves my own culture
from Mexico which contributes to the “Burrito” portion of this dish, and
the other involves Japan with the creation of “Sushi” (these items are
shown on the left of my image above) (Sushirrito, 2022). Mexico has
created several variations on the Burrito that involves different meats,
toppings, sauces, or tortillas, but the core essence of the dish remains
the same - a tortilla base (large enough to contain the contents) and a
mixture of ingredients tightly compressed into a delicious roll. On the
otherhand, Japan’s Sushi dish is a lighter version that includes more of
a fish variety than red meats. In comparison to the Burrito, Sushi is
also compressed into a roll, however, it is normally sliced into pieces
for the customer to enjoy and the ingredients are rolled in seaweed (now
that is a delicious alternative!).</p>

<p>At this point, the similarities of our two historical dishes share
what sound like a great mixture - a roll with ingredients. This led to
the adaptation of the delicious Sushirrito created by Peter Yen in 2008
when he noticed that this type of dish was not being served in
restaurants despite how tasty the combination was (Gabriele, 2019).
Thus, he began mixing the seaweed base from Japanese sushi in place of a
flour tortilla and adding rice cooked from Mexican dishes with
inclusions of red meat instead of seafood to give birth to a dish now
called the <em>Sushirrito</em> (with a restaurant to match) (Gabriele,
2019). The birth of this mixture even questioned physicians with the
association of Graft-versus-Host-Disease Prophylaxis where combination
of meats and ingredients resulted in different case study samples
improving overall health (Hashmi, 2021).</p>
<p><em>Note</em>: Hashmi’s 2021 case study was published in the academic
journal “Acta Haematologica” which contains a reputable history in
scientific exploration of human physiology and is utilized in this
article for my food’s academic source.</p>
