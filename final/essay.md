## Part 1

Asian cuisine consists of a long, rich history full of culture and sophistication when specifying their dishes. 
As described by St. Maurice, the global expansion of its associated dishes has swept the globe in awe and curiosity based on the included ingredients and final preparation delivery. 
For our intended scope, we will analyze the globalization of both Japanese and Turkish cuisines with respect to the four associated Global Competencies. 
It is important to realize that, while these associated cultures share many similarities due to their geographical position, there are unique traits that define each aspect respectively. 

Distinct foodways provide an abundant of differences and similarities in the Asian/Pacific rim area. 
They define what locations offer certain types of food based on what country is boarding the Pacific Ocean. 
One of the main differences in culture refers to the implications in the important emphasis on ethnicity (Karaosmanoglu, 2013) for Turkish-based culture. 
The difference in comparison with Japanese cuisine is the concern that unqualified chefs will add their own twist on traditional dishes, therefore creating a different item than intended (St. Maurice, 2017). 
They do, however, share an equal similiarity to apply their delicious talents on obtaining customers as the intended recipients. 
Whether its the ancient Japanese applications of fruits such as sudachi lime and pears (Jones, 2017), or Turkish implementations such as lamb, chicken, and eggplants (Karaosmanoglu, 2013), the purpose is to propose the best dish for their customers with a goal of business profits.

With regard to the globalization of Japanese cuisine, the result of diffusion is shown in various article examples. 
For example, St. Maurice explains that an interviewee described how "a one-pot meal for farming families that could be prepared relatively quickly after returning from a day in the field [clashes] with the image of a traditional rice, soup, and three side dishes (*ichiju sansai*) washoku meal". 
This clash demonstrates the mix of ingredients not typically incorporated in the Japanese cuisine dish and how the original elite chefs feel about its involvements in such a dish. 
As a reinforcement on perspective, St. Maurice also explains that said chefs are not appalled by the change in the original cuisine, but the original traditions are not being upheld. 

Transculturation is the key to globalization of both cuisines due to its reach into Western Civilization. 
The reason behind culturation is best explained as the response to greater health awareness, and an increased appreciation of healthy Japanese cuisine (Kumakura). 
This expanded to oversea presentations where conventions such as one held in 1998 at the Japan Society, New York, five speakers reported such themes such as the history of tableware used in Japanese cuisine, and European language/food in Japan (Kumakura). 
Restaurants such as *Nobu* found in large cities (Los Angeles, New York, London, Tokyo, etc...) also incorporate the health perspective by transforming the original Japanese cuisine dish to a more health conscious audience (Christopher, 2023). 
This is done by taking inspiration from Peru and European added flavours from items such as olive ouil, grape seed oil, and balsamic vinegar (Christopher, 2023) which is clearly derived from countries oversea.

Transculturation is a fantastic way to apply variety to a traditional dish standard, but it does occur with its set of difficulty at the border level. 
The greatest "food" problem is restrictions on the import/export capabilities. 
When certain items are banned from entering/exiting the country, it becomes difficult to obtain the target result from your desired dish. 
St. Maurice described the result of this border experience when tasting stir-fried mutton with fruit and sauce made from soy sauce, balsamic vinegar, and other flavoring agents by labeling the dish as "clearly Chinese cuisine". 
Such lack of ingredients to create a truly Japanese cuisine experience showed what was unable to cross the border on transport.

In conclusion, the global competencies applied to the globalization of Japanese and Turkish cuisines really influenced the variety of associated dishes available today. 
The abundant options selectable in Western Civilization culture add changes to the authenticity of the original dishes, but sometimes have a much more rich, umami result in comparison. 
While the new adaptation may sometimes be a better result, the original dish does have its unbeatable moments when the selected ingredients come together accordingly. 
The importance of ingredients, preparation, and cooking process really influences the dish as equally important with the global competencies.
