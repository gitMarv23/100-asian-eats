# Japan & Malaysia

Japanese tea is not only a delicious variety of beverages, it contains its own history. 
For Japanese tea to expand through transculturation, it must have an originating source. 
In actuality, tea was imported from China to Japan in the 8th century, and was used mostly for religious reasons. 
Originally, it was brought to Japan by monks when they visited China (Walker, 2023). 
In fact, history credits the monk Saisho as being the man who first brought tea leaves from China to Japan during the Heian period prior to the expansion of tea (Wouter, 2018). 
In comparison, tea origins in Malaysia have similarities based on transculturation from Chinese traders, but have more of a social preference (Kuoni, 2021). 
The climate and 1,500 meters above sea level made Malaysia an ideal location for the methods of tea leaf growth and how it would later evolve (Kopi).

During the tenth century, Chinese had begun to use powdered tea along with the development of the split bamboo whisk to stir it into hot water. 
This would lead the Japanese to prepare their tea by means of infusion - dipping or placing leaves in the hot water (Varley, 2023). Later, this tea was only used in the Japanese tea ceremony known as *chanoyu* that was created in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries which consists of four major aspects: rules, setting, behavior, and taste (Varley, 2023).
In this case, rules apply to the method of preparation for the tea ceremony where the other three aspects strive for ultimate perfection of the tea and its ambience. 
Thus, tea is seen as quintessentially Japanese in Japan via its construction as a 'cultural synthesis', which disassociates it from everyday experiences and thereby enables practitioners to re-internalize what is deemed quintessentially Japanese (Surak, 2006). 
Malaysia diffusion is slightly different than Japan. 
Since Malaysia is a multicultural nation, its tea has diffused into different enjoyment methods by the Malays, Chinese, and Indians (Poh). 
The most famous teas throughout Malaysia are known as the *Teh Tarik*, and it is a Chinese tea that is both cheap and available in most coffee shops that is consumed in large volumes by its locals (Poh).

The differentiation of zone applies to the methods of transculturation for tea throughout the ages in both locations. 
Where in Japan the tea was originally brought from monks and used for cultural ceremonies, Malaysian history was more impacted by its distance above sea level for preference of its bitterness. 
Diffusion affected the evolution of tea in both of these regions based on cultural use and cost. 
As previously mentioned, the most famous Malaysian tea is found because of its value amongst its taste, so if the cost for such leaves were to increase, the production would accordingly reduce. 
 It is interesting to see how such changes in tea occurred prior to the import/export of such tea we experience today in our own nation. 
Lastly, Surak's paper qualifies as an academic source due to its credibility as originating from a peer reviewed academic journal publication.
