<li><p>The food is called Tantanmen Ramen with a different approach
consisting only of vegetable broth with natural oils and spices (Primer,
2019). Tantanmen itself is a Japanese version of Chinese Sichuan Dan Dan
Noodles (Sarah &amp; Laura, 2020), and it was born in the Sichuan
Province of China that literally means “noodles being carried” (Boshi,
2019). Noodles in China are used culturally as a type of ‘cereal food’
which is the main source of energy for Chinese people and most
economical energy food (Zhang &amp; Ma, 2016). We also see the
transition of noodles in Western civilization in form of instant
ramen.</p></li>

section below. The Zhang &amp; Ma source qualifies as academic due to
its published work taken directly from the Journal of Ethnic Foods

Science Direct.</p></li>
<li><p>My design upholds the seven principles of Japanese aesthetics in
the following methods:<br />
<strong>Kanso</strong> - as defined by the <em>simplicity</em> or
<em>elimination or clutter</em>, this dish initially seems like it has a
lot going on, but on closer inspection we can note that everything has
been removed to focus only on what is inside the dish.<br />
<strong>Fukinsei</strong> - for this principle we needed
<em>asymmetry</em> or <em>irregularity</em>. This is why elements such
as color are popping in an irregular fashion and the spoon is adding the
loved diagonals in Japanese aesthetics.<br />
<strong>Shibui</strong> - simple without being flashy. What you see in
this dish is what you get. This is a Tantanmen Ramen dish and doesn’t
become overwhelmed with other dishes, desserts and so forth.<br />
<strong>Shizen</strong> - naturalness is demonstrated in the greenery
for this dish. The organic implications provide this principle through
such elements.<br />
<strong>Yugen</strong> - the broth is an excellent element for this
principle. More is implied by knowing that there are ingredients
underneath the broth surface layer, but the artist has ommitted showing
each ingredient to leave the pallate wondering what else the dish may
contain.<br />
<strong>Datsuzoku</strong> - the transition from conventional is implied
through the broth in this dish. Here it is ONLY made with natural oils
and spices compared to the usual approaches.<br />
<strong>Seijaku</strong> - the tranquility in this dish reflects in its
balance. To have the broth flow enough to show the delicious ingredients
and not have color, material, or placement clash with one
another.</p></li>
