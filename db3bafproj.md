# DB3 Project Post Explanation

1. The food is called Tantanmen Ramen with a different approach consisting only of 
vegetable broth with natural oils and spices (Primer, 2019). Tantanmen itself is a Japanese 
version of Chinese Sichuan Dan Dan Noodles (Sarah & Laura, 2020), and it was born in
the Sichuan Province of China that literally means "noodles being carried" (Boshi, 2019).
Noodles in China are used culturally as a type of 'cereal food' which is the main source
of energy for Chinese people and most economical energy food (Zhang & Ma, 2016). We also see
the transition of noodles in Western civilization in form of instant ramen.

source qualifies as academic due to its published work taken directly from the Journal of 
Ethnic Foods recognized by the Korea Food Research Institute and archived with Science 
Direct.


3. My design upholds the seven principles of Japanese aesthetics in the following methods:  
	**Kanso** - as defined by the *simplicity* or *elimination or clutter*, this dish 
		initially seems like it has a lot going on, but on closer inspection we can 
		note that everything has been removed to focus only on what is inside the 
		dish.  
	**Fukinsei** - for this principle we needed *asymmetry* or *irregularity*. This is 
		why elements such as color are popping in an irregular fashion and the 
		spoon is adding the loved diagonals in Japanese aesthetics.  
	**Shibui** - simple without being flashy. What you see in this dish is what you get. 
		This is a Tantanmen Ramen dish and doesn't become overwhelmed with other 
		dishes, desserts and so forth.  
	**Shizen** - naturalness is demonstrated in the greenery for this dish. The organic 
		implications provide this principle through such elements.  
	**Yugen** - the broth is an excellent element for this principle. More is implied 
		by knowing that there are ingredients underneath the broth surface layer, 
		but the artist has ommitted showing each ingredient to leave the pallate 
		wondering what else the dish may contain.  
	**Datsuzoku** - the transition from conventional is implied through the broth in 
		this dish. Here it is ONLY made with natural oils and spices compared to 
		the usual approaches.  
	**Seijaku** - the tranquility in this dish reflects in its balance. To have the 
		broth flow enough to show the delicious ingredients and not have color, 
		material, or placement clash with one another.
