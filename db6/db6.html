<h2 id="a-farmers-challenge">A Farmer’s Challenge</h2>
<p>Farmers face an abundant amuont of daily challenges when working in
an agricultural environment. Even locally in California, situtations
caused by greenhouse gas emissions have produced food security
challenges that need to be overcome by farmers (Brodt et. al, 2014).
Such climate changes are elements that farmers are currently unable to
directly control, but there are scientific methods (using modern
technology) that have been published to propose solutions for such
changes.</p>
<h2 id="possible-solutions">Possible Solutions</h2>
<p>For any type of problem, there is a solution. As such, the following
solutions were proposed in response to agricultural climate
warnings:</p>
<h3 id="change-planting-methods">Change Planting Methods</h3>
<p>A solution provided by Li et. al approaches the planting method
directly. Their method created a methodological framework based on
temperature-based rice growth season determination and GIS spatial
analysis to quantify the effect of climate warming and improvements in
planting methods (transplanting to direct seeding) (Li et. al, 2023). In
otherwords, the alternative approach would be transplanting based on the
optimal results obtained from the observation of 267 and 159 km
southward movement causing a 13.3% decrease in the study area! (Li et.
al 2023).</p>
<h3 id="climate-smart-rice">Climate Smart Rice</h3>
<p>With technological advancements involving artificial intelligence and
machine learning, why not apply the concepts to the agricultural
industry? That is precisely what Biswal et. al proposes with the
biological mediated genome engineering to develop <em>climate smart
rice</em>. This dynamic concept of rice that can adapt to its climate
changes is under development by analyzing the desirable phenotypes and
responsible genetic factors that can be altered to increase tolerance
toward undesireable weather conditions (Biswal et. al, 2019)!</p>
<h3 id="dynamic-double-season-rice">Dynamic Double-Season Rice</h3>
<p>This method provided by Zhang et. al uses statistical evidence based
on projections of greenhouse gas emission rates to increase the
plantation rate in preparation for the seasonal change. The data
accumulated predicted rates of change in thermal changes, secure
maturation, and even the potential growing season through the year 2095
(Zhang et. al, 2021).</p>
<h3 id="enhancement-of-drought-tolerance">Enhancement of Drought
Tolerance</h3>
<p>The final method found involves biological modifications to increase
the drought tolerance in rice by silencing the OsSYT-5 gene (Shanmugam
et. al, 2021). The OsSYT-5 gene is known as the synaptotagmin-5 gene
that is a sensing protein in charge of rice tolerance to water. By
<em>silencing</em> this gene, it was noted that the rice tolerance to
water significantly improved (Shanmugam et. al, 2021); this could
greatly impact the longevity of rice plantation for farmers whose crops
perish due to the changing weather challenges.</p>
<h2 id="impressions">Impressions</h2>
<p>The impressions on all four methods described above revolves around
the types of approaches available with modern technology. Situations
conceived only in science fiction movies such as genetic modifications
and dynamically adapting plants were quite the surprise to find that it
is occurring as this analysis is being written. Lastly, Biswal et. al
qualifies as an academic source discovered in the <em>Academic Search
Complete</em> Database from the California State University, Long Beach
Library list of databases. The information was published as a result
from the seminars in cell and developmental biology works and is
recognized amongst the scientific community.</p>
